# 🔢 Exploring NumPy – A Core Python Library for AIML

Being a student of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, it's crucial for me to master foundational libraries — and **NumPy** stands right at the heart of numerical computing with Python. 💡

After working through various concepts, I practiced all the key features of NumPy and noted them down in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easier for future reference and revision.

To understand NumPy in a beginner-friendly and detailed way, I followed an incredible video tutorial by **Shridhar Mankar Sir**. His teaching style is super clear and kept me engaged throughout.
